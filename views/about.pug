      h2 Why does Big Picture Consulting exist?
      |       We exist to serve leaders.
      br
      br
      |       Maybe you or someone you know has some great ideas, but you're not quite sure how to define and
      |       implement them.
      br
      br
      |       Maybe you have a big vision with big goals and need help prioritizing and communicating them to
      |       your leadership team. Or maybe you need help getting a vision and setting goals for you and your
      |       organization.
      br
      br
      |       Maybe you can’t quite see the forest because of all the trees. Maybe you can't get a clear view of the
      |       horizon because of the intense wind and waves raging all around you. Or maybe you could use a
      |       lighthouse to help you navigate the treacherous seas and rocky shores of business ownership.
