        Success is crucial. Shaping the strategy and executing it is essential. Operating
        efficiently is critical, and maximizing profits is absolutely mandatory. But why? The
        answer is people. Unless people enjoy working with you, like being around
        each other, and showing up each day with a pep in their step to work towards a
        common goal, there is no big picture. There is no underlying purpose and expanded
        meaning to their job. They are merely going through the motions, drawing a
        paycheck, and counting the days to the end of the workweek and their next
        vacation.
        <br><br>
        So how do you get people to read from the same book, be in the same chapter, and
        be on the same page, all at the same time? That’s where Big Picture Consulting is
        different from other management consulting firms. That is where we shine.
        <h2>There’s more to it.</h2>
