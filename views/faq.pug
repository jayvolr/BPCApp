        b Q:

        b A:
      |       BPCâ€™s owner and president, Glenn Love, and any associate consultants who
      |       work on BPC projects, are required to sign the Engagement Agreement which contains a very strict confidentiality
      |       clause, as well as a conflict-of-interest avoidance clause. BPC works hard to gain your trust, and thus take
      |       these issues extremely seriously in order to maintain your trust.

      span.answer
        b A:
      |       That depends on the scope and depth of the work we do, the size of your
      |       organization, the number of employees you have, the complexity of the project, and a variety other factors that
      |       must be considered. Before any work is done, the work required is carefully defined and put in writing,
      |       all phases of the project are outlined in writing, and the fee to be charged for each phase is provided.
      |       There are no surprises and no undisclosed add-ons (i.e., no "change orders") without prior discussion and prior
      |       written consent from the client.
