        b Q:
      |       How do I know you would hold in strict confidence any information I
      |       would share with you and not get into any conflict-of-interest situations that could potentially jeopardize my
      |       organization?

        b A:
      |       BPC’s owner and president, Glenn Love, and any associate consultants who
      |       work on BPC projects, are required to sign the Engagement Agreement which contains a very strict confidentiality
      |       clause, as well as a conflict-of-interest avoidance clause. BPC works hard to gain your trust, and thus take
      |       these issues extremely seriously in order to maintain your trust.

        b Q:
      |  How much are your fees?
      br
      br
      span.answer
        b A:
      |       That depends on the scope and depth of the work we do, the size of your
      |       organization, the number of employees you have, the complexity of the project, and a variety other factors that
      |       must be considered. Before any work is done, the work required is carefully defined and put in writing,
      |       all phases of the project are outlined in writing, and the fee to be charged for each phase is provided.
      |       There are no surprises and no undisclosed add-ons (i.e., no “change orders) without prior discussion and prior
      |       written consent from the client.

        b Q:
      |  What if we get started on a project together and have to delay it or cancel it for some
      |       reason, is that a problem?
      br
      br
      span.answer
        b A:
      |       Not at all. All of our projects consist of pre-defined phases, so if we need to pause some
      |       work we are doing, or cancel the project for any reason, we will wrap up the current phase
      |       and hope to resume working with you at some point in the future.
